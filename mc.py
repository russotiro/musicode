#
# * lark lets you define a translator to immediatety turn a lark parse
#   tree into a custom-formatted one
# * ly.music is a work in progress, designed for building a lilypond AST
# * ly.dom lets you do something similar, but is also pretty-printable
# * ly.dom is deprecated and will be removed when ly.music is finished
